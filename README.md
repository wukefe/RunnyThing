### Tests for assignment #3

- [Question 2](https://wukefe.github.io/RunnyThing/a3q2.html)
- [Question 3](https://wukefe.github.io/RunnyThing/a3q3.html)
- [Question 4](https://wukefe.github.io/RunnyThing/a3q4.html)


### Rubric

Total 36 points

  + q1: 3
  + q2: 15
  + q3: 5
  + q4: 10
  + q5: 3 (possible maximum 4 bonus points)

Note

- Total points have been changed from 40 to 36 since q5's point has been adjusted from 7 to 3;
- If you receive more than 3 points (out of 7) in q5, the extra points automatically become your bonus points;
- Your final grade should be `max(initial_grade + bonus, 36)`
